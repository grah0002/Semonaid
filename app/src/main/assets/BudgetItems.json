    "tips_1": "Commit to a longer lease\nIf you find the perfect little flat and you can see yourself living there for a while, it might be worth negotiating a 24-month lease with the landlord, in return for a slight reduction in rent.\n\nFinding suitable tenants can be an arduous process for landlords. It takes time and costs them money, as vacancies mean lost rent. So committing to a two-year lease could encourage them to knock $10 off your weekly expenditure.",
    "title_2": "CHOOSE YOUR STORE",
    "tips_2": "5. Live in the suburbs\nGenerally speaking, the further away from the centre of the city you get, the cheaper the rents will be. Think about your lifestyle, travel habits and social life. And then choose a cost-effective suburb that allows you to maintain as much as your current way of life as possible.\n\nDon’t rule out any suburbs until you’ve thoroughly researched them, either. The housing market is constantly changing and suburbs are being transformed with new builds. It might pay to revisit suburbs you ruled out a few years ago to see if they now fit your requirements."

    "tips_1": "In addition to delivery services, many grocery stores offer senior discount days with 10-20 percent off your total grocery bill. Ask at the customer service desk to find the best day to do your shopping.",
    "title_2": "CHOOSE YOUR STORE",
    "tips_2": "A larger chain store is more likely to offer discounts, manager specials, and accept more coupons than smaller stores. As an added bonus, their aisles are wider and they have more staff available to help you. All stores are different, however, so consider your preferences and select a store that caters to your needs."
